# Create-Performance-Task

**What does this project do?**
This project targets students that need a little help organizing their tasks
and responsibilities. The app allows the user to input their class name, current grade,
missing work and percentage of that work on your grade in that class. The user can then
click a button and visualize the number of certain tasks that need to be done.

**Why is this project useful?**
This project is useful because it is a resource to students that need a little extra 
help with organization and reduces stress by fitting all of their assignments into one
GUI. This app has the potential to increase students' performance in school.
